# Ping-Pong-Game 
This project demonstrates a Hand Gesture Controlled Ping Pong Game, where players use their hand movements as a paddle to control the game in real-time. Built using Digital Image Processing techniques, this game is a fun and interactive application of computer vision.

# Features
Hand Gesture Recognition: Uses webcam input to detect and track hand movements.
Real-Time Interaction: Smooth and responsive paddle control for an immersive gaming experience.
Digital Image Processing: Implements techniques such as contour detection, color segmentation, and motion tracking to recognize gestures.
Customizable Gameplay: Modify game settings like speed, difficulty, and paddle sensitivity.

# Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:
OpenCV: For image processing and hand detection.
NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.

# How It Works
The webcam captures real-time video input.
Hand gestures are detected using contour-based image segmentation.
Paddle movements in the game are controlled based on the detected hand position.
The game logic manages the ball, paddle collision, and scoring.
